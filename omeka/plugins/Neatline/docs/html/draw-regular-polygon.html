<h2 id="draw-regular-polygon">Draw Regular Polygon</h2>
<p>&quot;Draw Regular Polygon&quot; creates closed shapes just like the regular &quot;Draw Polygon&quot; tools, but it doesn&#39;t let you manually position the individual pionts - instead, it automatically creates a polygon with a given number of sides. This is useful if you want to create consistently-shaped geometric primitives (triangles, squares, circles, etc.), and it can also be a good way to sketch in basic components of more complex shapes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select the &quot;Draw Polygon&quot; radio button and move your cursor to the place on the map where you want to position the <em>center</em> of the polygon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click down and, while still holding down on the mouse button, move the cursor in any direction away from the center point. As you drag the mouse, a polygon will be dynamically rendered on the map with a radius equal to the distance between the cursor and the center point. Rotate the cursor around the center point to change the orientation of the polygon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the polygon is positioned correctly, release the mouse button to lock the shape in place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
