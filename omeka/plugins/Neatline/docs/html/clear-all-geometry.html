<h2 id="clear-all-geometry">Clear all Geometry</h2>
<p>This button is similar to &quot;Delete Shape,&quot; but it delete <em>all</em> vector annotations for the record. This can be useful when you&#39;ve made a mistake of some sort (for example, when experimenting with different ways of positioning an imported SVG document) and want to just completely clear out your work.</p>
