<p>By default, all of the sides of the polygon are equal in length (eg, a 3-sided shape is always an equilateral triangle, a 4-sided shape is always a square, etc). Check this box to make it possible to create &quot;skewed&quot; shapes with sides of different lengths - rectangles instead of squares, ellipses instead of circles.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: This setting can have strange interactions with certain &quot;Snap Angle&quot; values - if you need to create an irregular shape, it&#39;s generally easiest to set the snap angle to 0, drag out the shape, and then rotate it as needed with the &quot;Rotate Shape&quot; tool.</p>
