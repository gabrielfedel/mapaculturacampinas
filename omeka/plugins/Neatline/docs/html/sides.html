<h2 id="sides">Sides</h2>
<p>The number of sides on the polygon. For example, <code>3</code> will draw triandles, <code>4</code> squares, etc. As this number gets higher, the resulting shape will smooth out into a circle/ellipse. This is a good way to create circular shapes with &quot;real&quot; diameters that will expand and shrink with the zoom level of the map (as opposed to the circles used to represent points, which are &quot;dimensionless&quot; and always stay the same size - see the &quot;Draw Point&quot; section). Don&#39;t go overboard with the number of sides - in most cases, 30-50 sides is more than enough to create a smooth shape.</p>
