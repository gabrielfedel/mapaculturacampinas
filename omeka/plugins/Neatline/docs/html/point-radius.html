<h2 id="point-radius">Point Radius</h2>
<p>The radius of individual points on the map. You&#39;ll almost always want this value to be greater than 0 - otherwise, points will be invisible, in which case they should probably just be deleted. If you&#39;re making use of the &quot;Point Image&quot; field to change the visual representation of points (see the &quot;Editing Record Imagery&quot; guide), this field will also determine the size of the image graphics overlayed on the map.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The point radius is a static value, meaning that the size of the points on the map <em>won&#39;t change with the zoom level of the map</em>, as a polygon or line would. This is because points are actually just dimensionless pairs of lat/lon coordinates. Since they&#39;re infinitely small and have no measurable &quot;size&quot; that can be correlated to the scale of the map, the points will always stay the same size, regardless of the zoom level of the map</p>
