<h2 id="fill-color-selected-">Fill Color (Selected)</h2>
<p>The color of the &quot;body&quot; of points and polygons on the map (inside the lines, not including the lines themselves) <strong>when the record is highlighted or selected</strong> - for example, when the cursor hovers or clicks on the shape.</p>
<p>To change the color, click on the input and use the color-picker widget to select a new color. As you edit the value, the record&#39;s geometry on the map will automatically update to preview the new color.</p>
