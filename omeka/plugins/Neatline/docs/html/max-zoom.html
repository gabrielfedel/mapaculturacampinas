<h2 id="max-zoom">Max Zoom</h2>
<p>The zoom level &quot;below&quot; which the record will be visible, with zooming &quot;out&quot; being &quot;lower&quot; (eg, focusing on Europe is &quot;lower&quot; than focusing on Spain). For example, if the record has a point on the map and &quot;Max Zoom&quot; is <code>10</code>, then the point will be invisible when the map at zoom level <code>11</code>, and will become visible as soon as the map zooms to <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>Like with &quot;Min Zoom,&quot; click the &quot;Use Current&quot; button next to the field title to automatically insert the current zoom level into the input.</p>
