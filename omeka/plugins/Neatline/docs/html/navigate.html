<p>Select the &quot;Navigate&quot; radio button to enable the default panning interaction with the map - click and drag to move the map in one direction or another, and use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Think of Navigate as your &quot;home base&quot; - after sketching in new geometry with one of the drawing tools, it&#39;s usually easiest to reactivate &quot;Navigate&quot; mode, which has the effect of turning off any of the drawing or modification tools. This means that you don&#39;t accidentally add unwanted geometry the next time you click on the map.</p>
