<h2 id="stroke-width">Stroke Width</h2>
<p>The width, in pixels, of the lines that run around the edges of a shape on the map. Generally, it makes sense to keep this value in the range of 0-10 - anything more and the lines will start to &quot;clump&quot; together and blot out the shape of the polygon, especially when the map is zoomed back away from the vectors.</p>
<p>In some cases, it can be aesthetically pleasing to completely hide the lines, and just display the &quot;areas&quot; of shapes on the map. To do this, just set the stroke width to 0.</p>
<p>To change the opacity, type directly into the input or change the value smoothly down by clicking and moving the mouse up or down on the page.</p>
