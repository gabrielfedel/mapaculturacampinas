<h2 id="title">Title</h2>
<p>The title is the top-level snippet of text used to label the record in pop-up bubbles, on timelines, and in vertical listings of waypoints. Try to keep it short and simple, and avoid using complex formatting. A title isn&#39;t strictly required, but if you leave it blank you&#39;ll likely end up with some odd visual artifacts in your exhibit (empty preview bubbles, unlabelled points and spans on the timeline, etc).</p>
<p>If you want to add special formatting to the title (eg, make it bold, increase the size), click the &quot;Edit HTML&quot; link next to the field label. This will open a full-screen WYSWYG editor with a full load-out of formatting options. When you&#39;re done with the editor, click the <strong>Minimize</strong> button to return to the regular editing interface.</p>
