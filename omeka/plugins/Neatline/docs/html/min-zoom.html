<h2 id="min-zoom">Min Zoom</h2>
<p>The zoom level &quot;above&quot; which the record will be visible, with zooming &quot;in&quot; being &quot;higher&quot; (eg, focusing on Spain is &quot;higher&quot; than focusing on Europe). For example, if the record has a point on the map and &quot;Min Zoom&quot; is <code>10</code>, then the point will be invisible when the map at zoom level <code>9</code>, and will become visible as soon as the map zooms to <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>To set the value, just zoom the map the the level that you want to use for the value, and click the &quot;Use Current&quot; button next to the field title to automatically insert the current zoom offset into the input.</p>
