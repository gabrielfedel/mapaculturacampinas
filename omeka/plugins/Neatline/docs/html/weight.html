<h2 id="order-weight">Order / Weight</h2>
<p>The display order of a record relative to other records. This is similar to the &quot;Z-Index,&quot; but designed to be used in situations where records need to be put into a specific, unambiguous sequence (ie, where no two records can be in the same position in the sequence, as opposed to stacking order, in which multiple records can exist on the same &quot;layer&quot; or &quot;level&quot;). For example, this field is automatically populated by the Neatline Waypoints plugin to store the display order of records in the waypoints panel, a list of clickable record titles displayed on the map.</p>
