<h2 id="slug">Slug</h2>
<p>The slug is a plain-text identifier for the record - think of it as a human-readable ID that can be used to reference the record from other locations. For example, in the Neatline Text plugin - which makes it possible to connect text documents with Neatline exhibits - individual words or sentences can be linked to Neatline records by including the record slugs in the HTML markup. For example, if the text included something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span data-neatline-slug=&quot;paris&quot;&gt;Paris&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you had a record in your Neatline exhibit with a slug of <code>paris</code>, the word &quot;Paris&quot; document would be interactively linked with the location on the map. <strong>The slug isn&#39;t actually displayed anywhere in the public-facing version of the exhibit - if you&#39;re not using the Text plugin, it fine to just leave it blank.</strong></p>
