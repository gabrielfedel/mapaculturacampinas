<h2 id="body">Body</h2>
<p>The body is a catch-all field designed to house the main textual content for the record. Depending on what kind of content you&#39;re working with and how you&#39;re structuring the user-interface for the exhibit, it might make sense to enter anything from a short little blurb all the way up to a 10,000-word scholaraly essay.</p>
<p>Like with the title, click on the &quot;Edit HTML&quot; link to open up a full-screen WYSWYG editor for the field. Although it&#39;s generally a good idea to keep the formatting pretty minimal for the title, it fine to use much more elaborate and structural styling in the body - bullets and numbered lists, images, tables, etc.</p>
<p>Also, you can use the body as a space to include any kind of embeddable third-party multimedia content - videos from YouTube or Vimeo, audio from SoundCloud, etc. Just click on the &quot;Source&quot; button at the top left of the editor to activate view-HTML mode, and paste in the embed code.</p>
