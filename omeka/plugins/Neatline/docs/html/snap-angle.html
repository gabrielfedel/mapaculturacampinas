<h2 id="snap-angle">Snap Angle</h2>
<p>As you drag the cursor away from the center point, the rotation of the polygon will &quot;snap&quot; into a series of fixed angles. This makes it possible to create a series of shapes with the exact same orientation on the map (eg, a series of rectangles with sides that are all perfectly aligned with the cardinal directions). This field controls the size of the angle between each of the consecutive rotations.</p>
<p>For example, if you set a snap angle of <code>30</code> degrees, it will only be possible to orient the shape in a couple of different ways; as you decrease the angle, the rotation becomes and more granular, and at <code>0</code> the snapping is completely disabled.</p>
