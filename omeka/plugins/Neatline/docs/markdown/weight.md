## Order / Weight

The display order of a record relative to other records. This is similar to the "Z-Index," but designed to be used in situations where records need to be put into a specific, unambiguous sequence (ie, where no two records can be in the same position in the sequence, as opposed to stacking order, in which multiple records can exist on the same "layer" or "level"). For example, this field is automatically populated by the Neatline Waypoints plugin to store the display order of records in the waypoints panel, a list of clickable record titles displayed on the map.
