## Body

The body is a catch-all field designed to house the main textual content for the record. Depending on what kind of content you're working with and how you're structuring the user-interface for the exhibit, it might make sense to enter anything from a short little blurb all the way up to a 10,000-word scholaraly essay.

Like with the title, click on the "Edit HTML" link to open up a full-screen WYSWYG editor for the field. Although it's generally a good idea to keep the formatting pretty minimal for the title, it fine to use much more elaborate and structural styling in the body - bullets and numbered lists, images, tables, etc.

Also, you can use the body as a space to include any kind of embeddable third-party multimedia content - videos from YouTube or Vimeo, audio from SoundCloud, etc. Just click on the "Source" button at the top left of the editor to activate view-HTML mode, and paste in the embed code.
