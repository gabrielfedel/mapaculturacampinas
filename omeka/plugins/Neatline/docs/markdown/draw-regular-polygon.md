## Draw Regular Polygon

"Draw Regular Polygon" creates closed shapes just like the regular "Draw Polygon" tools, but it doesn't let you manually position the individual pionts - instead, it automatically creates a polygon with a given number of sides. This is useful if you want to create consistently-shaped geometric primitives (triangles, squares, circles, etc.), and it can also be a good way to sketch in basic components of more complex shapes:

  1. Select the "Draw Polygon" radio button and move your cursor to the place on the map where you want to position the _center_ of the polygon.

  2. Click down and, while still holding down on the mouse button, move the cursor in any direction away from the center point. As you drag the mouse, a polygon will be dynamically rendered on the map with a radius equal to the distance between the cursor and the center point. Rotate the cursor around the center point to change the orientation of the polygon.

  3. When the polygon is positioned correctly, release the mouse button to lock the shape in place.
