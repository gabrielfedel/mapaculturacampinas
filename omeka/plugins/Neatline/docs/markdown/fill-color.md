## Fill Color

The color of the "body" of points and polygons on the map - the area inside the lines, not including the lines themselves. This value is also used as a default color for the record in other contexts. For example, if the record has date information, the fill color is used to render the point or span that represents the record on the timeline.

To change the color, click on the input and use the color-picker widget to select a new color. As you edit the value, the record's geometry on the map will automatically update to preview the new color.
