## Modify Shape

Use this mode to change the shape of lines or polygons created with any of the drawing modes. It can also be used to change the position of stand-alone points.

  1. Select the "Modify Shape" radio button and click on the shape that you want to modify. Once the shape is selected, you should see a set of circular drag handles appear on top of each of the vertices in the shape.

  2. To change the position of an existing vertex, just click down on the point's drag handle, move the cursor to a different location, and release the mouse button to lock in the new location.

  3. To add new vertices to the shape, click and drag on any of the translucent points that are displayed in the middle of each of the sides of the shape. This has the effect of bisecting the vertex - as soon as you release the mouse button, the drag handle will be converted into a regular point, and you can then continue to progressively add detail to the shape by re-bisecting the new edges.
