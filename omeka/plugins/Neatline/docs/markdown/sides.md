## Sides

The number of sides on the polygon. For example, `3` will draw triandles, `4` squares, etc. As this number gets higher, the resulting shape will smooth out into a circle/ellipse. This is a good way to create circular shapes with "real" diameters that will expand and shrink with the zoom level of the map (as opposed to the circles used to represent points, which are "dimensionless" and always stay the same size - see the "Draw Point" section). Don't go overboard with the number of sides - in most cases, 30-50 sides is more than enough to create a smooth shape.
