## Start Date

The "first" or "beginning" date for an event. If the event is an instant (it happened exactly once, and did not occupy any kind of duration or interval of time), enter the date of the instant in this field.

**If you're working with NeatlineSimile**: If you just enter a "Start Date" and leave "End Date" blank, the record will be displayed as point on the timeline.
