## Title

The title is the top-level snippet of text used to label the record in pop-up bubbles, on timelines, and in vertical listings of waypoints. Try to keep it short and simple, and avoid using complex formatting. A title isn't strictly required, but if you leave it blank you'll likely end up with some odd visual artifacts in your exhibit (empty preview bubbles, unlabelled points and spans on the timeline, etc).

If you want to add special formatting to the title (eg, make it bold, increase the size), click the "Edit HTML" link next to the field label. This will open a full-screen WYSWYG editor with a full load-out of formatting options. When you're done with the editor, click the **Minimize** button to return to the regular editing interface.
