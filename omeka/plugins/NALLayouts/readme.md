Plugin for Omeka that adds custom layouts to Exhibit Builder 3.x. All layouts are somewhat responsive (galleries will be one item per row for smaller screens).

**NAL titlebar**: Adds a colored bar with the item's title above the item's caption.

**NAL Image Gallery/Document Gallery**: Automatically outputs an item's title and date. If there is a caption, it appears below these. If there is no caption, a snippet of the item's Description is appended, instead.

**NAL Movie Gallery**: Outputs two Moving Image items per row.
